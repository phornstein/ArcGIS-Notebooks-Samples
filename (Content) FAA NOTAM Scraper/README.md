The notebook in this repository is designed to scrape: https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.jsp for current NOTAMs. The notebook employs bs4 BeautifulSoup to parse the page HTML and discover NOTAM data. The notebook is designed to be scheduled for background running and will clear all stored NOTAMs in a feature service and replace them with all active NOTAMs. Only NOTAMs with available shapefiles are processed. To deploy this notebook first publish the NOTAMs layer in the layers.gdb to a Feature Service.
