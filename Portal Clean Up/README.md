# Portal Clean-Up

This notebook is designed to handle basic adminstrative tasks in an ArcGIS enterprise. The notebook will allow admins to search across the entire system for items that are tagged with specific tags, such as 'test', and automatically delete the content. The notebook will also search for users that have no logged in for a period of time and automatically return their licenses or deactivate the account.
