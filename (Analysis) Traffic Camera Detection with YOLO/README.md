# Object detection using Yolo3 and ArcGIS

These two notebooks showcase how you can easily integrate 3d party libraries and deep learning models like the opencv3 yolo3 model into ArcGIS.

The YOLO ObjectDetection WebCam notebook demonstrates basic object detection with yolo3's pretrained classes from the user's webcam.

The TFL Traffic Cameras notebook shows the application of the same yolo3 model to live traffic camera feeds. The detections from each traffic camera is then appended into an ArcGIS feature service for visualization and analysis.
