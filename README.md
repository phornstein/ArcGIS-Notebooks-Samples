# ArcGIS-Notebooks-Samples
A variety of sample notebooks using the ArcGIS API for Python

These notebooks serve as samples of how the ArcGIS API for Python and Notebook server can automate several tasks such as Portal Management, Content Curration, and Analysis

Each notebook includes:
- Documentation within the code
- If feature services are required, a gdb with templates
- If a notebook config file is required, a sample .txt config that should be completed and loading into the notebook files
